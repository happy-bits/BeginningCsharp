Solve the following exercise without baseclasses or interfaces.

The following code:

    var book = new Book();
    book.NextPage();
    book.NextPage();
    Console.WriteLine($"1) {book.Describe()}");

    var newspaper = new Newspaper();
    newspaper.NextPage();
    newspaper.NextPage();
    newspaper.NextPage();
    newspaper.Fold();
    Console.WriteLine($"2) {newspaper.Describe()}");

    var items = new List<object> { book, newspaper };

    TwoPagesForward(items);

    Console.WriteLine($"3) {book.Describe()}");
    Console.WriteLine($"4) {newspaper.Describe()}");
